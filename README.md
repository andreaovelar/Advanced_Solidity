# Advanced_Solidity

###  Advanced_Solidity_HW
####  Background
Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating a few 
### ProfitSplitter contracts. These contracts will do several things:
* Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.
* Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
* Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.

## Files  
* AssociateProfitSplitter.sol -- 
* TieredProfitSplitter.sol -- 
* DeferredEquityPlan.sol -- 

## Steps  
* Connect Ganache in local network, 
* Open metamask in local network and 
* Deploy contracts using remix.
* Please note that for last file deferred equity plan we are using the kovan network to test and view transactions on etherscan

## File AssociateProfitSplitter

Please find below screenshot in which we show the deployment in remix for Associate file using local network

## Useful links and info 
* https://kovan.etherscan.io/
* https://remix.ethereum.org/
* address used to deploy contracts 0x30B7C972578985dD504Cd6E1846d55faF25CF37E'

## Conclusions 
* We were able to use Ganache, Metamask, and remix for smart contract development 
* We use our local network as well as Kovan testnet
